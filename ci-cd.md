- Automatic code compilation with TFS: 100% in operation
- Automatic code scan with TFS: 100% ready
- Unit tests: build some templates, but... 
- Ubuild for J2EE app: complete
- Udeploy: in progress, but the progress is slow / stalled at the moment

## Random thoughts on Unit Testing

---

- The test-first culture has yet to be cultivated
- Do we believe in unit-testing / test-first?
- Can we afford the initial investment? 
- Our resources are mostly not trained for the test-first approach.
